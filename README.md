# MMM-mumble
A [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) Module to display users currently connected on the murmur server


## Dependencies
Because murmur's ICE API is such a pain to use and I'm really bad at Javascript, you need [this wrapper](https://github.com/ThePirateWhoSmellsOfSunflowers/murmur-ice/blob/master/rest_api_murmur.py).


## Usage
On the server side you need to configure the wrapper with the correct parameters and launch it (in a tmux, screen, deamon, whatever...).  

## Thanks
This module is ~~mostly~~ entirely based on [MMM-teamspeak3](https://github.com/Thlb/MMM-teamspeak3) and [MMM-bitcoin](https://github.com/valmassoi/MMM-bitcoin)
